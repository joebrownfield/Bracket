# Bracket

This repository contains the code for an app I am developing which allows users to see various exchanges in one location as well as use various API keys and wallet information to manage their digital currency portfolio.

### This is a work in progress
I am still actively working on this project so a lot of it could still use some refactoring and organization which will be done as I continue to work on the project.

## Getting started
### Initial View Controllers
Please refer to the CustomTabBarController.swift file which will show you the different View Controllers used.

Currently, the only exchange working and setup for most pull features is KuCoin but the rest of the exchanges you can still view.

### Installation
I have included the Cartfiles in the commits to the repository
